This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
stressanxiety<-read_csv(file="C:/Users/ushad/Downloads/StressAnxiety.csv")
stressanxiety
plot1<-ggplot(stressanxiety, aes(x=stress, y=anxiety)) + geom_point() +theme_classic()
plot2<-ggplot(stressanxiety, aes(x=stress, y=anxiety)) + geom_point() +theme_dark()
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol = 2)
```
```{r}
arrest<-read_csv(file="C:/Users/ushad/Downloads/Arrests.csv")
ggplot(arrest, aes(x = year, y = age, color=checks)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(sex ~ employed) + labs(title="Arrests for Marijuana Possession", color="hits in police records")

#how to apply conditional coloring, change coloring pallet or divide the y into age ranges ?

ggsave('Arrests1.png', width = 10, height = 6)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
